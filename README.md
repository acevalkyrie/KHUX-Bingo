# KHUX Bingo Version 0.0
A web app to generate and save a bingo board for users who are watching cutscene compilations of Kingdom Hearts Union Cross.
Created by Jesse Sordyl on 2/17/2023, very loosely inspired by the [BOTW Bingo](https://lepelog.github.io/botw-bingo) project.

## Site Use
The site is intended to be found at https://khuxbingo.acva.dev/ and is a simple web app accessible by anyone.
Functionality includes buttons to generate bingo cards or fill out and edit your own, as well as to save the contents to local storage to retrieve later.

## This project was made to help promote the Kingdom Hearts Union Cross Fan:Dub
